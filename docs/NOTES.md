# Open items to verify during implementation

- VIN regex must be ^[A-HJ-NPR-Z0-9]{17}$ (exclude I, O, Q),
  not ^.{17}$ — otherwise any 17-char string matches as VIN
- Plate/text normalization must live in ONE shared utility used
  by both the write path (@PrePersist) and the read path
  (SearchService) — no duplicated algorithm

## Import risks

- Re-import overwrites app edits, blanks included: a "-" in the
  Excel clears a stored value. Safe for the one-off migration,
  dangerous once the office edits data in the app.
- Re-import removes ownerships not present in the file. An
  incomplete Excel can silently break ownership links.
- Before the app goes live, decide whether import should become
  insert-only, or require an explicit "overwrite existing"
  confirmation.
- The ownership check on import counts only the owners written in
  the file. Ownerships with transfer dates are left untouched and
  not counted, so once the app records transfers, a re-import
  could leave a vehicle with shares above 100%.

## Deferred review findings

Not fixed yet. Findings 2 and 4 are from `docs/REVIEW-02.md`; the rest
came up while implementing the task named.

- **Finding 2, JPA cascade/orphan mismatch.** The database has
  `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `ownership` and `policy`, but the `@OneToMany`
  collections on `Customer` and `Vehicle` have no `cascade = REMOVE` and
  no `orphanRemoval`. JPA does not know about the cascade, so a hard delete
  can leave the persistence context stale or fail on ordering. Matters from
  Task 7, when the app starts editing and deleting through services.
- **Finding 4, `flush()` inside the import loop.** `ExcelImporterService`
  flushes after every row to pin a database error to its row. This defeats
  Hibernate's JDBC batching, so every row makes its own round trips. The
  per-row `findBy…` lookups add N+1 reads on top of that.
- **Policy number search (Task 5).** A policy number is only recognised
  as 10 digits starting with `21`, which fits the sample data but not
  other insurers' formats. `policy_number` is not part of any
  `search_normalized`, so other formats cannot be found at all. Consider
  adding it to a searchable field or adding a dedicated lookup.
- **Unknown ΑΦΜ finds nothing (Task 5).** A 9-digit input that is not a
  known ΑΦΜ returns no results instead of falling back to free text.
  Decide in Task 9 whether the UI should explain this or the search
  should fall back.
